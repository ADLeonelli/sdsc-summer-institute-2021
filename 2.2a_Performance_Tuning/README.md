## 2.2a. Performance Tuning
Bob Sinkovits, Director for Scientific Computing Applications, SDSC

This session is targeted at attendees who both do their own code development and need their calculations to finish as quickly as possible. We'll cover the effective use of cache, loop-level optimizations, force reductions, optimizing compilers and their limitations, short-circuiting, time-space tradeoffs and more. Exercises will be done mostly in C and Fortran, but emphasis will be on general techniques that can be applied in any language.
