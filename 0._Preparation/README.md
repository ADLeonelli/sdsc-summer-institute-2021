# Preparing for the Summer Institute 2021
You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of your week, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions if you have any problems with the start-up tasks.

## Preparation Activities:
The Summer Institute is a combination of in-depth lectures and hands-on learning. The following documents will guide you through the necessary steps needed to be prepared to get to work when you arrive at the Institute.

##  Computer Requirements:

* You will need to bring your own laptop for the summer institute. This will be used both for running software locally and connecting to SDSC’s supercomputers.
* For visualization tutorial a mouse with scroll wheel is highly recommended (laptop track pads are very difficult to use for 3D navigation).
