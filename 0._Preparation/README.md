# Preparing for the Summer Institute 2021
You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of your week, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions if you have any problems with the start-up tasks.

## Preparation Activities:
The Summer Institute is a combination of in-depth lectures and hands-on learning. The following documents will guide you through the necessary steps needed to be prepared to get to work when you arrive at the Institute.

##  Computer Requirements:

* You will need to bring your own laptop for the summer institute. This will be used both for running software locally and connecting to SDSC’s supercomputers.
* For visualization tutorial a mouse with scroll wheel is highly recommended (laptop track pads are very difficult to use for 3D navigation).

##  Account Requirements:

* You will be given an account on the SDSC Expanse computer. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the preparation day on Wednesday, July 28. 

## Software Requirements:
The document below contains a list of software being used at the institute and installation instructions:

## Remote access via GitHub, Zoom, and Slack:

* GitHub: Most of the training material will be located on the SDSC Summer Institute 2021 [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2021) and one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).   

* Zoom: You will need to install the latest [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) client, which is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Once installed, you can test your microphone and camera interface with Zoom [here](https://zoom.us/test). You can find more information on Zoom system requirements, including bandwidth requirements [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux).
