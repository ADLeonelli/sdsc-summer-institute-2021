## 3.1b. Machine Learning Overview
* Mai Nguyen, Lead for Data Analytics, SDSC
* Paul Rodriguez, Research Analyst, SDSC
 
SDSC Machine learning is an interdisciplinary field focused on the study and construction of computer systems that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning techniques can be used to uncover patterns in your data and gain insights into your problem.

This session provides an overview of the fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques used to explore, analyze, and leverage data to construct data-driven solutions applicable to any domain.

Topics covered include the machine learning process, data exploration, data preparation, classification, and cluster analysis. Concepts and algorithms will be introduced, followed by exercises to allow hands-on experience using Python.
