# Preparing for the SDSC Summer Institute 2021
You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of this workshop, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

 ## Computer and Laptop Set-up: <a name="computer-req"></a>
* We recommend a second screen for the hands-on sessions. The first to view the presentation, the second for hands-on.
* After you access your account information, confirm that you can login (SSH) to Expanse using the device you plan to use during the SDSC Summer Institute (laptop, workstation, etc...).  Detailed instructions on connecting to Expanse using SSH can be found [here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/connecting-to-hpc-systems).  

It has been suggested that a second monitor may be helpful during online instruction.  While one monitor could be used to follow instruction, the other for the hands-on.  Additionally, the use of a mouse may be beneficial as well during some sessions.

##  Remote access via GitHub, Zoom, and Slack <a name="remote"></a>
* GitHub:  Preparation and training material will be located on the SDSC Summer Institute 2021 [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2021) and one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).   

* Zoom: You will need to install the latest [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download), which is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Once installed, you can test your microphone and camera interface with [Zoom here](https://zoom.us/test). You can find more information on Zoom system requirements, including bandwidth requirements here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux). 
  * To ensure the security of our Zoom links, details will be sent to all participants just prior to preparation day (July 28) and again prior to the Summer Institute week (August 2 - 6).  When setting up your “display name” on Zoom, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC)) 

* Slack: We will also be using Slack as our main platform for announcements, where participants can communicate and ask for help. Download ([Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [MacOS](https://slack.com/downloads/mac), or [Linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)) and get [started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users).  Zoom chat will be disabled. Make sure to turn on your notifications to receive alerts.
  * Once you have downloaded the client, join the SI-SDSC-2021 workspace. See "...Preparation & Exercise" for link to join.
