The new era of data science is here. Our lives as well as any field of science, engineering, business and society are continuously transformed by our ability to collect meaningful data in a systematic fashion and turn that into value. These needs not only push for new and innovative capabilities in composable data management and analytical methods that can scale in an anytime anywhere fashion, but also require methods to bridge the gap between applications and compose such capabilities within solution architectures.

In this short overview, we will show you a plethora of applications that are enabled by data science techniques and describe the process and cyberinfrastructure used within these projects to solve questions.

We will also overview SDSCâ€™s AWESOME and SUAVE platforms for data management and visualization. Particularly, in this session, you will learn about: 
1. the basis process of data science
2. reference solution architectures for computational data science
3. the data management challenges when deal with steaming data, 
4. how social media datasets can be used within scienftific studies
5. graph analysis at scale
6. effectively applying basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods to survey data
7. examples for visualization of datasets through various end user platforms
